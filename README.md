## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://imgtr.ee/images/2023/04/15/yTMIr.png)

My e-commerce api is a personal project that i'm developing to actively apply and showcase the skills i have learned 
in web development. As a developer, i have decided to prioritize the backend development, as i believe that creating 
a robust and scalable application is crucial for ensuring a seamless user experience. To achieve this, i am using 
Flask, a popular Python web framework, and PostgreSQL, a powerful and reliable database management system.

The e-commerce api allows users to create their own accounts and purchase products from other users. Additionally, 
the api includes a rating system that enables users to rate and evaluate products they have purchased, providing 
valuable feedback to both buyers and sellers.

As a developer, i am committed to creating a secure and reliable application that can handle large amounts of traffic 
and user data. With Flask and PostgreSQL, i have the flexibility and scalability needed to build a platform that can 
meet these requirements.

Overall, this e-commerce api is a personal project that demonstrates my passion for web development and my commitment 
to learning and applying new skills. By prioritizing backend development and leveraging the latest web technologies, 
i aim to create a platform that provides a fast, secure, and seamless user experience for buying and selling products 
online.
